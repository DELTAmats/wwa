Major investments were made in seawalls and wave barriers, but all these eff orts failed. Mangrove replanting was also not successful as the conditions were not right, such as the input of suffi cient sediment. The fl oods kept on creeping further into the village and taking the land by 100 meters every year. People became\ndesperate and made plans to move away, having witnessed neighbouring villages already being swallowed by the sea.\nBut then a new solution was introduced in the village, called \u201cBuilding with Nature\u201d. This solution entails the placement of permeable dams (see picture) and was made possible by Wetlands International, Deltares and the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Aff airs and Fisheries (MMAF). The permeable dams break the waves and trap sediment thus reclaiming land. Once the land is back, mangroves can recolonize the area and help protect the coastline against erosion.\nVillagers had been waiting impatiently to see the evidence of success of this new \u2018permeable structures\u2019 approach. And this day had come. The waves are clearly much lower inside the grid of permeable dams than outside. In some cases, pionering mangrove trees are already testing the ground.\nA major breakthrough came when the village signed a decree, demarcating 100 hectares of the currently lost land as protected area. This means that once the mangrove belt is restored, it will not suff er the same fate again.

The sand is gradually redistributed along the shoreface, beach and dunes by wind and currents. By using natural processes to redistribute the sand, this innovative approach aims to limit the disturbance of local ecosystems, while also providing new areas for nature and more types of recreation.\nThe Sand Motor is a coastal mega-nourishment pilot project which was constructed in 2011, with the means to improve the efficiency and effectivity of the Dutch coastal nourishment strategy. Since the 1980s, the Netherlands nourish their sandy coast to balance the continued erosion of their coastline. Usually, each 3 to 5 years, sand is extracted offshore and brought to the coast, either to the foreshore, or to the beach. With the Sand Motor, a hugely increased amount of nourishment sand has been deposited in the foreshore:  an amount equalling 4 to 5 times the usual amount, in total ca. 20 million ton of sand in the shape of a hook formed a peninsula. \nThis nourishment served three main goals:\n- Increase coastal safety: the sand would spread along the shore, and feed the beach and dunes, over a period of ca. 20 years.\n- Increase natural diversity: adding low-energy environments would increase habitat diversity, and the natural dispersion of sand would result in less degradation of the benthic community compared to the usual sand nourishment strategy.\n- Increase attractiveness: by adding a dynamic, and broader beach, the area would become  more attractive to people and increase visits to the area.\nA monitoring and research program was put in place to follow whether the goals were met, and to study the relationships between waves, tides, sand and natural diversity, both below and above water.\nThe morphodynamic process resulted in a flattening of the peninsula, through erosion of the outer edge, and deposition at the northern and southern areas near the Sand Engine. Transport was mainly north, but also the southern bight of the peninsula received a significant amount of sand. The northern area was slowly filled up, closing the lagoon during a large part of the tidal cycle, and creating an increased number of breaker banks. This area became a rather extended intertidal area with an increased number of species due to the relatively small grain size.\nPath forward\nFrom the early days, the Sand Engine experiment has been a collaborative effort between public authorities, private companies and research institutes. As a result, the Sand Engine has become a focal point for coastal research and an innovative coastal management solution. Over the next years, the project will be closely monitored and extensive research programs have been defined that will include detailed studies of the evolution of the Sand Engine and the driving mechanisms behind it \u2013 physical, ecological as well as social. The fact that researchers from different disciplines are studying the same object motivates the interaction and stimulates interdisciplinary science development. For example, the science project NatureCoast, combining six different disciplines, organised a 6-week interdisciplinary field campaign to obtain a unique multidisciplinary data set of the Sand Engine. In addition, the close involvement of end-users (public and private) challenges the researches to focus on specific research topics and how to disseminate the new knowledge. \nConstruction March 2011 \u2013 November 2011, research still ongoing", "MaterialLink": "add map of sandy coasts of the world.
